# BEV_Occupancy_Detection_from_Multiple_Roadside_Cameras_for_ITS

## Abstract

3D perception of traffic participants from a single camera on the roadside faces significant challenges due to occlusion and limited field of view. Moreover, fusing information from multiple cameras at the image feature level is difficult because of different view angles. Furthermore, the necessity for practical implementation and compatibility with existing traffic infrastructure compounds these challenges. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel probabilistic Bird-Eye-View (BEV) road occupancy detection framework that leverages multiple cameras on the roadside to overcome the aforementioned limitations. A synthetic dataset encompassing diverse scenes and varying camera configurations is generated using the CARLA simulator, and three detection models are developed. Subsequent extensive evaluation of these models showcases our framework and explains the performance influence of using multi-views and different BEV grid sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate another pipeline for data collection in the real world, which complements our synthetic data. We further evaluated the sim-to-real capability of our model to ensure its practical application, showing insight into the influence of robust dataset design in refining ITS perception systems. Our research aims to advance 3D traffic perception so as to improve traffic management, operational efficiency, and road safety.
